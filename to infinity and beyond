/**Some more recent (and geeky) boardgames use dice with different numbers of sides
 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, ... . Write a Java program called Dice that first asks the user
 for the number of sides on the dice he or she wants to roll, and then simulates a random
 roll with that die and prints the result.
 Your program should roll a fair dice, with equal probabilities for all possible outcomes
 and work for all whole positive numbers, not just for the 6 values listed above.*/
